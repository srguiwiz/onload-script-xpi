An Add-on for Mozilla Firefox

Run an external onload script for some documents.
Intentionally limited to file URI scheme.

Made to allow processing without need for script reference and
onload attribute in the document itself.

First use has been as Adj framework processor for SVG documents.
It helps making workflow more passable.
